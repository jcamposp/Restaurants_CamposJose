# Statement 1

## Show a list of restaurants from an array

### Task

You have to implement a restaraunt reviews web project.  
In this task, we will do the main web page, `index.php`, that shows a list of the most 5 valued restaurants. This list of restaurant information will be stored in an array, and to obtain this list of restaurants, we will call a function named `getRestaurants()`.  
You have to show this information of each restaurant:  
+ Name
+ Locality
+ Route
+ StreetNumber
+ PostalCode
+ PhoneNumber
+ A photography

You can search restaurants in this page:  
https://www.tripadvisor.es/Restaurants-g187463-Palma_de_Mallorca_Majorca_Balearic_Islands.html

The main web page will have the following responsive desing, made with Bootstrap.
